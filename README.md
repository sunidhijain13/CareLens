# 🌼 CareLens

**Your Emotional Wellness Companion**  
🧠 Built for the [DevNetwork AI + ML Hackathon](https://devpost.com)

CareLens is a gentle, GPT-powered reflection tool designed for caregivers and anyone navigating emotional overload. It helps you check in with your feelings, understand your mood, and receive compassionate encouragement.

---

## 💡 Inspiration

Behind every strong patient is often an even stronger caregiver someone who gives everything and rarely gets the support they need. I built CareLens to change that to offer emotional check-ins for the ones who are always checking on others.

---

## ✨ What It Does

- 💬 Lets you write out how you're feeling
- 🧠 Detects emotion from your reflection (demo-powered)
- 🌸 Offers a comforting AI response, even in demo mode
- 🎀 Provides a soft, pastel UI designed to feel like a hug

---

## 🔧 How I Built It

- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Styling:** Custom CSS in Streamlit Markdown
- **AI Logic:** GPT-style response (demo fallback) + Hugging Face emotion detection
- **Hosting:** Local demo-ready (Cloud-ready too!)

---

## 🧠 Why It Matters

CareLens is not just a chatbot. It's a space for emotional validation—for the quiet strength of caregivers and anyone needing a moment of softness. The design, tone, and functionality are all centered around empathy.
